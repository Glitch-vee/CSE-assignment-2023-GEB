**0.0.1** <br>Write a program that takes an integer value input and print its binary, octal and hexadecimal value as output.  

**Input:** 29

**Output:** 11101 35 1D


<br>**0.0.2** <br>Write a program that prompts the user to input two numbers and display its HCF. The Highest Common Factor (HCF) also called the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two whole numbers, is the largest whole number that’s a factor of both of them.

**Input:** 24 32 

**Output:** 8


<br> **0.0.3** <br>Write a program that takes an integer number as input from user and prints the following shape.

**Input:** 5

**Output:**
<pre>
    1

   222

  33333

 4444444 

555555555
</pre>


<br> **0.0.4** <br>Write a program that takes an integer number as input from user and prints the following shape.

**Input:** 5 

**Output:**
<pre>
1
212
32123
4321234
543212345
</pre>

<br> **0.0.5** <br>Write a program that takes an integer number as input from user and prints
the following shape.

**Input:** 5

**Output:**
<pre>
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
</pre>

<br> **0.0.6** <br>Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program
should calculate the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered.
For example, if the user enters 20, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, … 20.

**Input:** 20

**Output:** 210

<br> 

**0.0.7**<br>Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer. Your program
should find and display the sum of digits of number. For example, sum of digits
of number 32518 is 3+2+5+1+8 = 19

**Input:** 32518

**Output:** 19

<br>

**0.0.8** <br> Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should
then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number. A
prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. For
example, the number 5 is prime because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and
5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by I,
2, 3, and 6.

**Input:** 5

**Output:** Prime

**Input:** 6

**Output:** Not Prime

<br>

**0.0.9** <br>Write a Python program that accepts a string from user. Your program should
create and display a new string where the first and last characters have been
exchanged.

**Input:** HELLO

**Output:** OELLH

<br>

**0.0.10** <br>Write a Python program that accepts a string from user. Your program should
create a new string by shifting one position to left.

**Input:** HELLO

**Output:** ELLOH

<br>

**0.0.11** <br>Write a Python program that accepts a string and two letters from user. Your
program should create a new string by replacing one letter with other.
**Input:** HELLO L P

**Output:** HEPPO

<br>

**0.0.12** <br>Write a Python program that takes a list of integers from user. Your program
print out sum, max, min and avg of all integers.

**Input:** 5 10 12 89 45 35 77 11 49 99

**Output:**
<pre>
Sum: 432
Max: 99
Min: 5
Avg: 43.2
</pre>


<br>

**0.0.13** <br>Write a Python program that takes a list of integers from user. Your pro-
gram print out sum, max, min and avg of all odd integers and even integers
separately.

**Input:** 5 10 12 89 45 35 77 11 49 99

**Output:**
<pre>
Sum (even): 22
Sum (odd): 410
Max (even): 12
Max (odd): 99
Min (even): 10
Min (odd): 53
Avg (even): 11.0 
Avg (odd): 51.25
</pre>

<br>


**0.0.14** Write a Python program that takes a list of integers from user. Your program print out the integers which occurred only once in the list.

**Input:** 7 5 5 1 6 7 8 7 6 

**Output:** 1 8

<br>

**0.0.15** <br> Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.” If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.” The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. Program should count and display number of tries to win the game.
